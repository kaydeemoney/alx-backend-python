Overview
This repository serves as a collection of exercises and projects aimed at enhancing backend development skills. It covers a wide range of topics, including Python programming, APIs, web frameworks (like Flask or Django), database management, unit testing, and more.

Projects
Below is a list of some of the key projects included in this repository:

0x00-python_variable_annotations
Introduction to type annotations in Python, how to use them, and why they are useful.

0x01-python_async_function
Learn how to write asynchronous code in Python using asyncio and await to improve performance.

0x02-python_async_comprehension
Understanding asynchronous comprehensions and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

0x03-python-restful_api
Create a simple RESTful API using Flask. Handle HTTP requests and responses, work with URL routes, and perform CRUD operations.

0x04-python_orm
Explore Object Relational Mappers (ORM) in Python using SQLAlchemy. Learn how to interact with databases in an object-oriented manner.

0x05-python_unit_testing
Write unit tests for Python code using the unittest framework. Understand the importance of test coverage and TDD (Test-Driven Development).

0x06-python_flask_middleware
Implement middleware in Flask applications to manage request/response cycles and add extra functionality like authentication, logging, and caching.

0x07-python_flask_authentication
Dive into authentication systems in Flask, such as token-based authentication and OAuth2.

Technologies Used
This repository makes use of the following tools and technologies:

Python 3.x: Main programming language for all projects.
Flask: A micro web framework for building APIs and web applications.
SQLAlchemy: A powerful ORM library for Python to interact with databases.
unittest: Python’s built-in testing framework for unit tests.
asyncio: Python’s library for writing asynchronous programs.
MySQL: A relational database management system used in some projects.
SQLite: A lightweight database engine for development and testing.
Installation
To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend-python.git
cd alx-backend-python
Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies (if applicable): Each project might have its own dependencies listed in a requirements.txt file. To install them, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run a specific project or module:

Navigate to the corresponding project directory, e.g.:

bash
Copy code
cd 0x03-python-restful_api
Execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python3 app.py
For projects that use Flask, you may need to set environment variables, such as:

bash
Copy code
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
For async projects:

bash
Copy code
python3 0-main.py
